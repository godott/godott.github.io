I am a senior quantum scientist at AWS Center for Quantum Computing, where my work bridges Quantum Error Correction theory and the control stack --- what I think of as the Quantum Operating System layer. Previously, I was at <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/braket/'>Amazon Braket</a>, the quantum cloud division at AWS, where I helped shape the software strategy. I helped introduce <a href='https://openqasm.com'>OpenQASM3</a> as the standard language specification and and design and build the compilation and translation stack to supoprt it. One example of the tools is <a href='https://github.com/amazon-braket/autoqasm'>AutoQASM</a>, of which I conceived and built the first prototype. I also lead a few research initiatives, including <a href='https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mheule/publications/SATmap.pdf'>high-performance solver based</a> and <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05115v1'>ML-based</a> quantum circuit mappers. I obtained my Ph.D degree from <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the University of Chicago</a> and my advisor was <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ftchong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frederic T. Chong</a>. 

My research interests lie in quantum compilation, quantum architecture design and formal verification. The main theme of my research is breaking abstraction layers in the current quantum computing stack and re-establishing new abstraction layers, examples including breaking the quantum gate abstraction by pulse-level compilation, and breaking the qubit abstraction by using bosonic qubit encodings. For a summary, see our <a href="https://mrmgroup.cs.princeton.edu/papers/pieee2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PIEEE review article</a> with collaborators from UChicago, Princeton, Duke, IBM, AWS and Caltech.
