I am a senior quantum scientist at Amazon Braket, leading the quantum compilation efforts. Previously, I obtained my Ph.D degree from <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the University of Chicago</a> and my advisor was <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ftchong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frederic T. Chong</a>. Before that, I got my bachelor degree from <a href="https://illinois.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign</a>. During my Ph.D, I also stayed at IBM for 1 year as the <a href="https://qisenet.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NSF QISE-NET fellow</a>, working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yK_ZfbwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrew
Cross</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-I6kav0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ali
Javadi-Abhari</a>, and spent a summer at <a href="https://www.anl.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Argonne National Lab</a> as the <a href="https://www.anl.gov/mcs/wj-cody-associates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W.J.Cody fellow</a>, working with <a href="https://www.anl.gov/profile/paul-hovland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Hovland</a>. I contributed to several quantum compilers, including <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3519939.3523431" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giallar</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Qiskit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/epiqc/ScaffCC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ScaffCC</a>.

My research interests lie in quantum compilation, quantum architecture design and formal verification. The main theme of my research is breaking abstraction layers in the current quantum computing stack and re-establishing new abstraction layers, examples including breaking the quantum gate abstraction by pulse-level compilation, and breaking the qubit abstraction by using bosonic qubit encodings. For a summary, see our <a href="https://mrmgroup.cs.princeton.edu/papers/pieee2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PIEEE review article</a> with collaborators from UChicago, Princeton, Duke, IBM, AWS and Caltech.
