      abstract={Quantum simulation, fundamental in quantum algorithm design, extends far beyond its foundational roots, powering diverse quantum computing applications. However, optimizing the compilation of quantum Hamiltonian simulation poses significant challenges. Existing approaches fall short in reconciling deterministic and randomized compilation, lack appropriate intermediate representations, and struggle to guarantee correctness. Addressing these challenges, we present MarQSim, a novel compilation framework. MarQSim leverages a Markov chain-based approach, encapsulated in the Hamiltonian Term Transition Graph, adeptly reconciling deterministic and randomized compilation benefits. We rigorously prove its algorithmic efficiency and correctness criteria. Furthermore, we formulate a Min-Cost Flow model that can tune transition matrices to enforce correctness while accommodating various optimization objectives. Experimental results demonstrate MarQSim's superiority in generating more efficient quantum circuits for simulating various quantum Hamiltonians while maintaining precision.}

      abstract={Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes are essential for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). However, their implementation faces significant challenges due to disparity between required dense qubit connectivity and sparse hardware architectures. Current approaches often either underutilize QEC circuit features or focus on manual designs tailored to specific codes and architectures, limiting their capability and generality. In response, we introduce QECC-Synth, an automated compiler for QEC code implementation that addresses these challenges. We leverage the ancilla bridge technique tailored to the requirements of QEC circuits and introduces a systematic classification of its design space flexibilities. We then formalize this problem using the MaxSAT framework to optimize these flexibilities. Evaluation shows that our method significantly outperforms existing methods while demonstrating broader applicability across diverse QEC codes and hardware architectures.}

In the simulation of Fermionic quantum systems, efficient Fermion-to-qubit mapping plays a critical role in transforming the Fermionic system into a qubit system. HATT utilizes ternary tree mapping and a bottom-up construction procedure to generate Hamiltonian aware Fermion-to-qubit mapping to reduce the Pauli weight of the qubit Hamiltonian, resulting in lower quantum simulation circuit overhead. Additionally, our optimizations retain the important vacuum state preservation property in our Fermion-to-qubit mapping and reduce the complexity of our algorithm from O(N4) to O(N3). Evaluations and simulations of various Fermionic systems demonstrate a significant reduction in both Pauli weight and circuit complexity, alongside excellent scalability to larger systems. Experiments on the Ionq quantum computer also show the advantages of our approach in noise resistance in quantum simulations}

      abstract={Quantum Computing (QC) is a new computational paradigm that promises significant speedup over classical computing in various domains. However, near-term QC faces numerous challenges, including limited qubit connectivity and noisy quantum operations. To address the qubit connectivity constraint, circuit mapping is required for executing quantum circuits on quantum computers. This process involves performing initial qubit placement and using the quantum SWAP operations to relocate non-adjacent qubits for nearest-neighbor interaction. Reducing the SWAP count in circuit mapping is essential for improving the success rate of quantum circuit execution as SWAPs are costly and error-prone. In this work, we introduce a novel circuit mapping method by combining incremental and parallel solving for Boolean Satisfiability (SAT). We present an innovative SAT encoding for circuit mapping problems, which significantly improves solver-based mapping methods and provides a smooth trade-off between compilation quality and compilation time. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 78 instances covering 3 quantum algorithms on 2 distinct quantum computer topologies, we demonstrate that our method is 26x faster than state-of-the-art solver-based methods, reducing the compilation time from hours to minutes for important quantum applications. Our method also surpasses the existing heuristics algorithm by 26% in SWAP count.}

Additionally, we design an adaptive code layout that accommodates our defect mitigation strategy while ensuring efficient execution of logical operations. Our evaluation shows that Surf-Deformer outperforms previous methods by significantly reducing the end-to-end failure rate of various quantum programs by 35× ∼ 70×, while requiring only ∼ 50\% of the qubit resources compared to the previous method to achieve the same level of failure rate.

Bosehedral overcomes the challenge of handling infinitedimensional qumode gate matrices by performing all its program analysis and optimizations at a higher algorithmic level, using a compact unitary matrix representation. It optimizes qumode gate decomposition and logical-to-physical qumode mapping, and introduces a tunable probabilistic gate dropout method.

  abstract = {Recent developments in engineering and algorithms have made real-world applications in quantum computing possible in the near future. Existing quantum programming languages and compilers use a quantum assembly language composed of 1- and 2-qubit (quantum bit) gates. Quantum compiler frameworks translate this quantum assembly to electric signals (called control pulses) that implement the specified computation on specific physical devices. However, there is a mismatch between the operations defined by the 1- and 2-qubit logical ISA and their underlying physical implementation, so the current practice of directly translating logical instructions into control pulses results in inefficient, high-latency programs. To address this inefficiency, we propose a universal quantum compilation methodology that aggregates multiple logical operations into larger units that manipulate up to 10 qubits at a time. Our methodology then optimizes these aggregates by (1) finding commutative intermediate operations that result in more efficient schedules and (2) creating custom control pulses optimized for the aggregate (instead of individual 1- and 2-qubit operations). Compared to the standard gate-based compilation, the proposed approach realizes a deeper vertical integration of high-level quantum software and low-level, physical quantum hardware. We evaluate our approach on important near-term quantum applications on simulations of superconducting quantum architectures. Our proposed approach provides a mean speedup of $5times$, with a maximum of $10times$. Because latency directly affects the feasibility of quantum computation, our results not only improve performance but also have the potential to enable quantum computation sooner than otherwise possible.},

  abstract = {Quantum computing is on the cusp of reality with Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) machines currently under development and testing. Some of the most promising algorithms for these machines are variational algorithms that employ classical optimization coupled with quantum hardware to evaluate the quality of each candidate solution. Recent work used GRadient Descent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) to translate quantum programs into highly optimized machine control pulses, resulting in a significant reduction in the execution time of programs. This is critical, as quantum machines can barely support the execution of short programs before failing.However, GRAPE suffers from high compilation latency, which is untenable in variational algorithms since compilation is interleaved with computation. We propose two strategies for partial compilation, exploiting the structure of variational circuits to pre-compile optimal pulses for specific blocks of gates. Our results indicate significant pulse speedups ranging from 1.5x-3x in typical benchmarks, with only a small fraction of the compilation latency of GRAPE.},

	abstract = {Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill (GKP) states appear to be amongst the leading candidates for correcting errors when encoding qubits into oscillators. However the preparation of GKP states remains a significant theoretical and experimental challenge. Until now, no clear definitions for fault-tolerantly preparing GKP states have been provided. Without careful consideration, a small number of faults can lead to large uncorrectable shift errors. After proposing a metric to compare approximate GKP states, we provide rigorous definitions of fault-tolerance and introduce a fault-tolerant phase estimation protocol for preparing such states. The fault-tolerant protocol uses one flag qubit and accepts only a subset of states in order to prevent measurement readout errors from causing large shift errors. We then show how the protocol can be implemented using circuit QED. In doing so, we derive analytic expressions which describe the leading order effects of the nonlinear dispersive shift and Kerr nonlinearity. Using these expressions, we show that to mitigate the nonlinear dispersive shift and Kerr terms would require the protocol to be implemented on time scales four orders of magnitude longer than the time scales relevant to the protocol for physically motivated parameters. Despite these restrictions, we numerically show that a subset of the accepted states of the fault-tolerant phase estimation protocol maintain good error correcting capabilities even in the presence of noise.},

This predicate (ρ,δ) can be computed adaptively using tensor networks based on the Matrix Product States. Gleipnir features a lightweight logic for reasoning about error bounds in noisy quantum programs, based on the (ρ,δ)-diamond norm metric.

We show that multiple optimization objectives can be coordinated through the key abstraction layer of Pauli strings, which are the basic building blocks of computational chemistry programs. In particular, we leverage Pauli strings to identify critical program components that can be used to compress program size with minimal loss of accuracy. We also leverage the structure of Pauli string simulation circuits to tailor a novel hardware architecture and compiler, leading to significant execution overhead reduction by up to 99%. While exploiting the high-level domain knowledge reveals significant optimization opportunities, our hardware/software framework is not tied to a particular program instance and can accommodate the full family of computational chemistry problems with such structure.

With Giallar, we implemented and verified 44 (out of 56) compiler passes in 13 versions of the Qiskit compiler, the open-source quantum compiler standard, during which three bugs were detected in and confirmed by Qiskit. Our evaluation shows that most of Qiskit compiler passes can be automatically verified in seconds and verification imposes only a modest overhead to compilation performance.},
